    <p>Hello, I'm Aldo Saenz, a passionate oil painter inspired by emotion, texture, and light. My work focuses on capturing human connection and natural movement in a timeless, traditional style.</p>
    <p>I began painting in high school and continued to develop my technique through experimentation, study, and reflection. This site showcases selected works that I feel best represent my voice and journey as an artist.</p>
